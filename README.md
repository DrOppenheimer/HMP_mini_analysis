# HMP_mini_analysis
Code and results for an analysis of a subset of HMP data using R and MG-RAST

The only files you need are:

    tutorial.HMP_subset.9-1-15.R

    HMP.30_mgrast_ids.9-1-15

All other files are just examples of the outputs that are generated when you 
perform the analysis outlined in the R file applied to the mgids in the 
second. These are included as examples - or can be used as inputs if the API
is acting up or if you are conducting a tutorial with a large number of users
at the same time.
